# Automotive-Depreciation-Calculator

The goal of this project is to create a program that can calculate the depreciation of a car over time. This is useful for individuals who are interested in buying or selling a car, as it can help them determine the current value of the vehicle based on its age, mileage, and other factors. The project will be written in Python, and it will utilize various libraries such as pandas and matplotlib to help with data analysis and visualization.

Here's a high-level overview of the steps we'll need to take to create the automotive depreciation calculator:

Collect data: We'll need to collect data on the car in question, including its make, model, year, mileage, and condition. This data can be collected from a variety of sources, including online listings, vehicle history reports, and personal observations.

Clean and process data: Once we have the data, we'll need to clean and process it to ensure that it's consistent and accurate. This might involve removing outliers, correcting data errors, and standardizing data formats.

Calculate depreciation: We'll use a variety of techniques to calculate the depreciation of the car over time. This might include using regression analysis to model the relationship between the car's age and its value, or using industry-standard depreciation rates to estimate the car's value based on its age and mileage.

Visualize results: We'll use the matplotlib library to create visualizations of the data and the depreciation calculations. This might include scatter plots of the car's value over time, bar charts comparing the car's depreciation to industry averages, and heat maps showing the relationship between various factors (such as age, mileage, and condition) and the car's value.

Output results: Finally, we'll output the results of the analysis to the user. This might involve displaying a graph or chart, or simply printing out a text-based report with the calculated depreciation and other relevant information.
